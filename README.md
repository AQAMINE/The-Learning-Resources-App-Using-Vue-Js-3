Running my Code
If you want to run this code, you need to follow these steps:
1. You must install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing 
3. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
